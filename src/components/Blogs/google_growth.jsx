                      <h6>2. Gemini-Powered Search and LLM Expansion</h6>
                      <p>Gemini, Google’s AI successor to BERT and MUM, powers SGE with AI-generated summaries and prioritizes content with clear expertise and citations.</p>

                      <h6>3. Anti-Spam and Parasite SEO Crackdown</h6>
                      <p>New penalties target manipulative tactics like parasite SEO, auto-generated spam, and outdated content masked as fresh updates.</p>

                      <p>AI is fine for assistance, but content must be edited, refined, and reviewed by humans for quality and trustworthiness.</p>

                      <h6>4. Speed, UX, and Mobile Experience Still Matter</h6>
                      <p>Core Web Vitals, mobile optimization, and performance remain key ranking factors with real-time indexing now in effect.</p>
